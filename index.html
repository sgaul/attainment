        <h2>Educational attainment indicators</h2>
<p>This section covers indicators related to the educational attainment of Hartford area residents. </p>

<h2>Data and limitations</h2>

<p>Data on educational attainment typically comes from the U.S. Census Bureau&#39;s American Community Survey (ACS). This means that data is available with town or neighborhood-level detail, but only by combining several years of samples (3 to 5), making trend analysis difficult. </p>

<p>The ACS does provide several breakouts for educational attainment - by age, by whether the individual is employed / unemployed, by nativity (US or foreign-born), etc. - although the margin of error for these subgroups increases the smaller the group. </p>

<p>The ACS provides several levels of educational attainment; most indicator reports look at high-school diploma and college degree. The <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_B23006&amp;prodType=table">four standard levels</a> though are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Less than high school graduate</li>
<li>High school graduate</li>
<li>Some college or associate&#39;s degree</li>
<li>Bachelor&#39;s degree or higher</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do we already know?</h2>

<p>Educational attainment rates are among the most frequently-used indicators in local and national reports. Below are references for some, with details on how the data is used. </p>

<h3>Local</h3>

</ul>

<h2>Sample results</h2>

<p>The sample results are for all towns in Hartford and Tolland Counties since it is easier to extract ACS data that way. This can be trimmed to a smaller region later though. </p>

<p>By town, Hartford has the highest percent of individuals with less than a high-school education - almost 30 percent of the adult population. New Britain, East Hartford and Somers have rates that are also significantly higher than the surrounding towns. Most other towns in the region have fewer than 10 percent of adults with less than a high-school education. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1"> </p>

<p>Since the data is drawn from the ACS, there are margins of error associated with the values, which can be large for small towns. In practice, this means we cannot effectively distinguish the levels for many towns in the region, especially small towns. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2"> </p>

<p>The next category are those with a high-school degree only. Here, some rural towns have high rates - Union, Stafford and Windsor Locks have the highest rates in the region (although with high margins of error).</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3"> </p>

<p>Those with some college education or an associate&#39;s degree are the next group, again with high rates in some rural and suburban towns. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4"> </p>

<p>The percent with a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher is highest in the more affluent towns in the region - Avon, Simsbury, West Hartford, Glastonbury and Farmington all have above 60 percent of adults with a bachelor&#39;s degree. Hartford, by comparison, has fewer than 15 percent of adults with a bachelor&#39;s degree.  </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-5.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5"> </p>

<p>The ACS data can be looked at by neighborhood (for 5-year estimates); below are maps of the region for those with a bachelor&#39;s degree and those with less than a high-school education. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-6.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6"> </p>

<p>Adults with a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher; the map shows some more detail than by town (for instance, most college-educated adults in Hartford live downtown). </p>
